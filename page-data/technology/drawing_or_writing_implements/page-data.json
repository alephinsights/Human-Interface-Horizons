They may also draw on handwriting recognition technologies, which would learn to recognise the styles of different users. They could be combined with AI translation technologies to convert any text to other languages, as per normal text input.","legalEthicalImplications":"There are no assessed significant legal and ethical issues relating to the use of drawing or writing implements.","strategicImpactAssessment":"The DLOD impacts are likely to be minimal, but the broader availability of handwriting and drawing technologies within Defence might require a cultural shift within the organisation, which has become very used to standard business software for the production of text and graphics.","typeOfTechnology":"Stylus position on a screen is often similar to touch screens actuated with a finger, using resistive or capacitive sensors on a grid. Light pens are also used, with photosensitive components placed on a layer on the screen. High (pixel level) precision can be achieved with additional optical sensors in the stylus, by indexing individual uniquely coded screen pixels. There are a range of common standard technologies implemented in commercial devices, many of which are under active development.","prominentDevelopers":"Companies such as [reMarkable](https://www.takram.com/projects/zensei/) are involved in the production of e-ink drawing tablets which utilise styluses. [Qian Yedan](http://www.qianyedan.com/3d-stylus) is an example of a company producing a 3D stylus for use in augmented reality.","disruptiveness":"Incremental","sensory":"Visual (text):Visual (non-text)","environment":"Air:Cyberspace:Electromagnetic:Land:Littoral:Maritime:Space","overview":"This category of technology includes handheld implements that mimic pens or pencils and can be used to draw, write or point / select. This includes the styluses used with some smartphones and tablets, but also extends to longstanding technologies such as light pens.\r\n\r\nRecent developments include drawing implements that are used inside virtual environments to draw three dimensional objects. Developments in drawing surfaces are also an important enabler for these interfaces, such as the emergence of digital ink and electronic paper, which allow a more natural sketching interaction to occur. Stylus pens currently in development may incorporate their own displays integrated into the body of the pen, to allow users to select the type of drawing effect they require. These interfaces are increasingly likely to become bidirectional in terms of their information flow, as they begin to relay feedback to their users, relating to features such as texture. For example, some developments are currently focusing on introducing vibro-haptic feedback for erroneous use for educational/training purposes (e.g. where a word is spelt incorrectly with the pen).","image":{"publicURL":"/Human-Interface-Horizons/static/50bafe50e493f88cf780064062c7cb62/6 - Drawing or writing
