# Project Overview
The Human Interface Horizon tool was produced by [Aleph Insights](https://www.alephinsights.com) as a formal deliverable of the HS 1.005 Optimising Human System Integration (OHSI) - Human Machine Interface (HMI) - Future System Design for the [Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/defence-science-and-technology-laboratory). It was delivered as part of the [Human Social Science Research Capability (HSSRC)](https://www.baesystems.com/en-uk/product/human-and-social-science-research-capability--hssrc-).

It represents an explorable resource that presents information about emerging human-machine interface technologies and the future environment in which they might be used, with a particular focus on the defence and security setting.
